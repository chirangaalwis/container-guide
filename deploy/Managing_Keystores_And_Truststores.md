WSO2 product deployment.

### Asymmetric Encryption in WSO2 Products

WSO2 products use asymmetric encryption by default for the authentication and protection of data. For advanced details,
please refer the official WSO2 [documentation](https://docs.wso2.com/display/ADMIN44x/Using+Asymmetric+Encryption#UsingAsymmetricEncryption-setting_up_keystoresUsageofkeystoresinWSO2products).

During this process, [Java keystores and truststores](https://docs.wso2.com/display/ADMIN44x/Using+Asymmetric+Encryption#UsingAsymmetricEncryption-Understandingkeystoresandtruststores)
are used.

Please refer the official WSO2 [recommendations](https://docs.wso2.com/display/ADMIN44x/Using+Asymmetric+Encryption#UsingAsymmetricEncryption-recommendationsRecommendationsforsettingupkeystoresinWSO2products)
for managing keystores prior to following this guide.

### Manage Keystores and Certificate Truststores in Container Based Deployments

As per aforementioned WSO2 [recommendations](https://docs.wso2.com/display/ADMIN44x/Using+Asymmetric+Encryption#UsingAsymmetricEncryption-recommendationsRecommendationsforsettingupkeystoresinWSO2products),
it is often required to customize the default, WSO2 product keystore and truststore in a production grade deployment.

The most appropriate approach for introducing a custom keystore or a truststore to a container based deployment is by using
volume mounting.

1. Prepare the custom Java keystore.

   Please follow the official guidelines for [creating a new keystore](https://docs.wso2.com/display/ADMIN44x/Creating+New+Keystores#CreatingNewKeystores-Creatinganewkeystore)
   or [adding a Certificate Authority signed certificate to an existing keystore](https://docs.wso2.com/display/ADMIN44x/Creating+New+Keystores#CreatingNewKeystores-ca_certificateAddingCA-signedcertificatestokeystores)
   as per your preference.
   
   To import certificates to a truststore, follow the official [documentation](https://docs.wso2.com/display/ADMIN44x/Creating+New+Keystores#CreatingNewKeystores-Step3:Importingcertificatestothetruststore).
   
2. Add the keystore to the product container via a volume mount depending on the container platform.

   We recommend you to use the volume mount point allocated for non-configuration resources in WSO2 product containers
   (i.e. `/home/wso2carbon/wso2-artifact-volume`) for this purpose.
   
   In Carbon Kernel **version 4** based products, the default `wso2carbon.jks` keystore is located at the
   `<WSO2_PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/resources/security` directory. Thus, you may mount the volume containing the
   custom keystore to `/home/wso2carbon/wso2-artifact-volume/repository/resources/security` directory.
   
   In Carbon Kernel **version 5** based products, the default `wso2carbon.jks` keystore is located at the
   `<WSO2_PRODUCT_HOME>/resources/security` directory. Thus, you may mount the volume containing the custom keystore
   to `/home/wso2carbon/wso2-artifact-volume/resources/security` directory.
   
3. Add the truststore to the product container via a volume mount depending on the container platform.

   We recommend you to use the volume mount point allocated for non-configuration resources in WSO2 product containers
   (i.e. `/home/wso2carbon/wso2-artifact-volume`) for this purpose.
   
   In Carbon Kernel **version 4** based products, the default `client-truststore.jks` truststore is located at the
   `<WSO2_PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/resources/security` directory. Thus, you may mount the volume containing the
   custom keystore to `/home/wso2carbon/wso2-artifact-volume/repository/resources/security` directory.
   
   In Carbon Kernel **version 5** based products, the default `client-truststore.jks` truststore is located at the
   `<WSO2_PRODUCT_HOME>/resources/security` directory. Thus, you may mount the volume containing the custom keystore
   to `/home/wso2carbon/wso2-artifact-volume/resources/security` directory.
    
   > In Kubernetes based WSO2 product deployment, it is advisable that you use a ConfigMap resource to add the custom keystore
   > and truststore.
